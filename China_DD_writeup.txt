China in 1815 is represented by the Great Qing with its numerous vassals and viceroyalties. Chinese production and consumption are central to the world economy, but a steadily rising population combined with an inefficient semi-feudal system of land ownership has led to unemployment and famine, while increasing reliance on foreign silver has caused the devaluation of domestically-mined copper. Playing as the Great Qing or one of its devolved administrations, you will not find easy answers to these problems, although you may feel like the real answers are staring you in the face. In addition, economic problems are contributing to a rising wave of Chinese nationalism against the Manchu political elite. The widespread White Lotus Rebellion of 1808, and its 1813 aftershock in which 200 radical Buddhists from the Eight Trigrams sect stormed the Forbidden Palace itself, has dented the imperial Aisin Gioro clan's sense of invincibility and led to a crackdown on all unorthodox religious activities.
