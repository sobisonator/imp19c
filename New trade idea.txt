Every country gets its market penetration in every TZ.
Market penetration = {
    ROOT Shipping power % in TZ
    ROOT Market penetration % in every other country with shipping power in TZ
    Countries sharing a customs union with ROOT in TZ share 100% of their market penetration

    Every country also adds a "free trade" amount to the TZ penetration of its TZ, based on its free trade policy. A country with 100% free trade gives 100% of its shipping power to all other countries as TZ a penetration bonus
}

Every TZ creates TRADEGROUPS, which are the groups of governorships per country or customs union inside of that TZ
Quickest way to do this?

Every governorship declares its SELL to the TZ AGGREGATE STOCKPILE
The TZ records the % of TZ AGGREGATE STOCKPILE from each TZ, into each governorship

Every TZ declares its TZ AGGREGATE STOCKPILE to the global pool GLOBAL STOCKPILE
Global pool records the % of GLOBAL STOCKPILE from each TZ

We get a global unit price by adding every TZ's unit price multiplied by its contribution % together

Every country then gets its GLOBAL $TRADEGOOD$ MARKET PENETRATION and its $tradegood$ UNIT PRICE
Global $tradegood$ market penetration = {

    add = global_$tradegood$_contribution_%_TZ_1
    multiply = ROOT.market_penetration_%_TZ_1
    ...
    add = global_$tradegood$_contribution_%_TZ_22
    multiply = ROOT.market_penetration_%_TZ_22

    add = global_$tradegood$_contribution_%_TZ_global
    multiply = ROOT.market_penetration_%_TZ_global

    result = A percentage based on the ROOT country's global access to tradegoods
}
country $tradegood$ unit price = {
	global unit price / 0.5 + global market penetration
}

TZs declare their TZ AGGREGATE ORDER to the global pool's GLOBAL ORDER TOTAL
Global pool records the % of GLOBAL ORDER TOTAL from each TZ

If GLOBAL ORDER TOTAL for $tradegood$ is < GLOBAL STOCKPILE, then every TZ fulfils its whole order
else, each TZ fulfils its order partially based on the % of GLOBAL ORDER TOTAL
This gives the FINAL TZ IMPORT

Every governorship is issued a % of the TZ's FINAL TZ IMPORT based on its % of the TZ AGGREGATE ORDER, multiplied down by the % of the owner country's GLOBAL $TRADEGOOD$ MARKET PENETRATION

The local price of the tradegood is what is paid by upper strata to the workers if they are lower strata or proletariat. Indentured labourers and slaves do not get paid based on tradegood price. Upper strata will "buy" the amount of goods exported off the workers, after orders are complete, and pay them (unit price x actual amount exported). Upper strata will keep the full profit of the trade
So, the lower the local price is compared to the price it was sold for on the market, the more beneficial for upper strata

After the TZ imports are done, governorships also pay transport costs based on the distribution of TZs from which they bought
