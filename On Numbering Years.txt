Numbered years could be useful for a lot of flavour content, not only in monarchies. For example, with customisable localisation the "august reign of" or "year of" text on the GovernmentView can be replaced dynamically with things like "The 3rd Year of the Cleaver Administration" or "The 22nd Year of the Jiaqing Era" depending on government type. For AI republics the year number doesn't really need to be calculated, but for some AI monarchies and especially the Chinese one it's probably useful for calling up the value in event localisations.
