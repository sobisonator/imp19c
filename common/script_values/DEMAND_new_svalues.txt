### FOOD
# Demand must factor in some form of elasticity - substitutions of different food types factor in here.

# Demand = Unfulfilled food need /7 x (1- % difference in price)
# Divide by 7 for the 7 types of food good
# e.g. if wheat is 50% more expensive than the average food tradegood, the demand for wheat is:
# ( Unfulfilled food need / 7) x 0.5
# if vegetables are 25% cheaper than the average food tradegood, the demand of vegetables is:
