### FOOD
# Demand for each food tradegood is equal to:
# Get the % difference of the tradegood in question vs the average price of all food tradegoods, -1
# Price = Unfulfilled food need /6 x (1- % difference in price)
# Divide by 6 for the 6 types of food good
# e.g. if wheat is 50% more expensive than the average food tradegood, the demand for wheat is:
# ( Unfulfilled food need / 6) x 0.5
# if vegetables are 25% cheaper than the average food tradegood, the demand of vegetables is:
# ( Unfulfilled food need / 6 )x 1.25
