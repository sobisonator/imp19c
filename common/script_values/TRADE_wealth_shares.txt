# Consumer shares: which groups are spending on goods bought locally.
# When importing, the actual amount of wealth transferred is reduced based on how much could actually be imported, with an additional amount derived from this_quarter_balance_$tradegood$ if the balance is negative. Otherwise, the amount ignores exports (positive balance) and just accounts for consumer demand.
# The higher the price, the more of the share goes towards upper classes
