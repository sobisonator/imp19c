# Mark out rivals
# There are different types of rivals depending on the balance of power

# Oppose - country should confront this rival head-on as a fight between equals
# Fear - country should seek the help of stronger nations against this rival 
# Domineer - Country should subsume this rival into their empire or sphere of influence
# Subvert - Country should knock down this rival's power

	# - Try to vassalise the target (is small)
	# - Try to vassalise the target and move on to others (is tiny)
	# - Try to take land directly from the target (is big and holds core land)
	# - Try to give land to an ally or new vassal (is big and holds non-core land)

	# Diplomatic parity determines how much pressure root can put on target
	# Or if parity is imbalanaced, root will seek more support before putting pressure on

	# Some actions "cost" less pressure to do and will therefore be more attractive to countries that are more on-par, or where root is less powerful than target

# TODO:
## Creating an actual wishlist:

# Add all the provinces in those list to a new list
# Order that list again by desirability, and add a big weight to desirability for bordering any owned province of the AI_root, or being coastal
# This way, the AI should try to make wishlists of contiguous, or sea-bordering, sensible provinces to take in a peace deal
## Taking provinces:
# Now iterate through the wishlist of provinces and add each one to a new list, actual takeable_provinces, and add their warscore cost to a local_var
# Once the accumulated warscore cost is above the affordable warscore end and transfer land
# If there's still un-expended warscore and we've done all in the list, go back to ## Creating an actual wishlist
# ...and do it again, treating provinces in the takeable_provinces list as owned by AI_root for the purposes of this iteration

# In the case of peace proposals to human players, the takeable_provinces list is presented as a list of demands for the player to accept or reject

# TODO: Consider how this needs to work handing land to subjects or allies, not just warleader

# In the case where the AI_root wants to vassalise the war target, expend warscore on that first, then consider taking land for themselves using the above wishlist method, but only for provinces over a certain desirability threshhold.
