#*            The Purchase Order Plan            *
#*************************************************


#1. Wealth from pops in the governorship should all be pooled up to determine the "Purchasing Power" of the governorship for that quarter.
#	- This would be "WEALTH_governorship_total"

#2. Then sort demand by how important the trade good is.

#3. The purchase order will then be made to nearby trade zones that have an available stockpile for the goods that are in demand.

#4. Once the order is sent the movement cost between the trade zones can be factored in along with the price of the good. This will give the final price of the order.

#5. After the order is made the goods will be "moved" into the stockpile of the governorship that ordered them.
