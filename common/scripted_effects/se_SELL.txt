	# Method plan:
	# 1. Get the total sold from the TZ (so we need to be storing this in a gradually growing variable whenever a PO is completed, and that needs to be reset to 0 every quarter)
	# 2. Divide that by the cut percentage of this governorship (multiply if it's being done as <1, you get the idea)
	# 3. Subtract that amount from this governorship
	# e.g. total sold from the TZ is 1,500 out of 3,000 offered
	# ... this governorship's cut is 12%
	# ... so this governorship has to deduct 180 goods from its stockpile (and it would have offered 360)
