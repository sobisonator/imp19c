# Example #
# let's say you have 3 tiers:
# Tier 0: priority 0, population_per_building = 1.0, population_ratio 1.0
# Tier 1: priority 1, population_per_building = 0.5, population_ratio 0.5
# Tier 2: priority 2, population_per_building = 2.0, population_ratio 0.25
# The province has 10 pops
# Tier 2 will be used first because it has the highest priority.
# 	it has population_ratio of 0.25, which means it will "consume" up to 10 * 0.25 pops ( in this case 2.5 )
#	population_per_building is 2.0, which means it can only place one building and 0.5 pops are left unused. 
# Tier 1 will be used second. Remaining pops in the province is now 8.0 ( the previous tier placed one building at the cost of 2 pops )
#	population_ratio is 0.5 which means it can consume 4 pops.
#	population_per_building is 0.5, resulting in 8 buildings.
# Tier 0 will be used last and get's to consume all of the remaining 4 pops ( population_ratio = 1.0 )
#	population_per_building = 1.0 so 4 buildings will be placed
#
# In total the 10 pops in the province resulted in 13 (1+8+4) buildings
# Had there been 20 pops in the province there would be 26 (2+16+8) buildings
# Increasing population_ratio on Tier 2 to 0.5 would result in 20 (5+10+5) buildings
