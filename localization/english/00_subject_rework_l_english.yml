subject_focus_1_t:0 "Commerce Focus"
subject_focus_1_desc:0 "The lands of our subjects are ripe for economic development. They are already blessed with fertile lands and an industrious people, and by commanding that they focus their considerable talents into their improving their local economy, our entire nation will prosper because of it."
subject_focus_1.a:0 "Commerce is the Way!"
subject_focus_1.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_2_t:0 "Military Focus"
subject_focus_2_desc:0 "It is no secret that the men of our subject nations are a contentious bunch, quick to anger and willing to fight over the slightest provocations, be they real or imagined. Would it not make sense for us to tap into this wellspring of wrath? The hotheads of our subjects would make fierce additions to the ranks of our military...we should train these youth and harness them for our own needs, lest they eventually direct their aggression towards the state."
subject_focus_2.a:0 "A Stronger Army is needed!"
subject_focus_2.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_3_t:0 "Development Focus"
subject_focus_3_desc:0 "The docile inhabitants of our subjects have no greater wish than to see their own holdings flourish under [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s hegemony; a desire that we also share. We shall give them our blessing and allow them to focus on their internal development, knowing that we, too, shall gain from a content and thriving populace."
subject_focus_3.a:0 "Development will bring Prosperity!"
subject_focus_3.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_4_t:0 "Increased Tribute"
subject_focus_4_desc:0 "After extensive discussions with the financial advisors of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that all subject states should increase the amount of tribute that they send to us every month. Considering the staggering expenses that have been paid into maintaining the territories of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], it is only natural that these burdens should be shared by the peoples benefitting from our benevolence."
subject_focus_4.a:0 "It is our prerogative to place indemnities"
subject_focus_4.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_5_t:0 "Increased Integration"
subject_focus_5_desc:0 "It has been decided that the current situation in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is not to our satisfaction; the people in our subject nations are slowly being influenced by the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName] ways. However, this is not happening as quickly as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would like. Of course, we could...'suggest'...that this process be accelerated, but there are likely to be ramifications outside of our control. What should we do?"
subject_focus_5.a:0 "Hopefully they will like us"
subject_focus_5.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_6_t:0 "Cultural Focus"
subject_focus_6_desc:0 "In order to ensure that proper [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] and [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName] ways are embraced throughout the entirety of our dominion, we could command our subjects to focus on assimilating our beliefs. The differences between our cultures are nominal, anyways; this should be a relatively painless process, to the benefit of us all...all that is left is for you to say the word."
subject_focus_6.a:0 "Great Idea!"
subject_focus_6.b:0 "What a shame"
subject_focus_6.c:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea."

subject_focus_8_t:0 "Increased Autonomy"
subject_focus_8_desc:0 "It has been suggested by many of the subjects of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to relax some of the onerous taxes that we have placed upon them. Although [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] isn't a fan of the idea of decreased incomes, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] are aware that this coin is two-sided; this gesture, while expensive, would ultimately result in increased loyalty of our subjects. Besides, it wouldn't be the worst thing to have their elites owing us a favor..."
subject_focus_8.a:0 "This will do the trick"
subject_focus_8.b:0 "If anything they should pay more..."

Predictably, it has been suggested that we could spread some wealth around, in order to remind the elites where their loyalties lie...'tis an expensive thing, managing the ship of state. What would you have us to do?"
subject_focus_individual.1.a:0 "Shower them with gifts"

A simple thing, really; you give the command, and the bureacracy responsible for the day-to-day operations within a territory will begin to focus on the specific task you give them. As head of our nation, we are responsible for directing the energies of our people; we will shape the destines of our lands as we see fit.

subject_focus_individual.3.desc:0 "The trade incomes in [recipient.GetName] are booming, thanks to the peace and prosperity that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has brought to the region. The might of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName] arms has allowed the mercantile class to flourish, and, as such, we are entitled to a cut of these profits. We have invested our blood and wealth into [recipient.GetName]; it is our right to skim a little off of the top of their treasuries. Inform their leaders of our expectations."
subject_focus_individual.3.a:0 "It shall be done"

subject_focus_individual.4.t:0 "[recipient.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Joins the War"
subject_focus_individual.4.desc:0 "Although the loyalties of [recipient.GetName] are dubious during the best of times, our current military entanglements require us to take what some might consider to be drastic steps. Although they were initially hesitant to join our soldiers in the field, when presented with an alternative (at the tip of a spear), [recipient.GetName] wisely decided to send their men. We will slay our enemies together and return to the matter of their insolence at a future date."
subject_focus_individual.4.a:0 "Together, we shall be triumphant!"

subject_focus_individual.5.t:0 "The People of [recipient.GetName]"
subject_focus_individual.5.desc:0 "In order to properly understand the diverse peoples living under our banner, we have decided to bring some of the inhabitants of [recipient.GetName] to our capital city; it is our sincere hope that, in time, these people will embrace [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName] ways. There might be some grumbling, to be sure, but we prepared for whatever might happen."
subject_focus_individual.5.a:0 "Fantastic"

subject_focus_individual.6.t:0 "Forced Levy"
subject_focus_individual.6.desc:0 "There is no way to honey these words; we have a manpower crisis, my [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetTitle], and if we don't take care of it, we could lose everything. It appears that our military advisors did not properly plan for the logistical problems that we would face, and now our reserves of fighting men are frighteningly low. Although this goes against normal practice, we can compel the men [recipient.GetName] to join our armies - this will be tremendously unpopular, but we don't have much choice in the matter."
subject_focus_individual.6.a:0 "We need the men"
