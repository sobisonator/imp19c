 military_building:0 "Training Camp"
 military_building_desc:1 "The agrarian nature of the early ancient world necessitated seasonal military campaigns, during the summer months between the planting and harvest seasons. Every year the citizens would muster in a field outside the city limits, such as the Agorai of the Greek city states or the Campus Martius of Rome, in preparation for that year's war against their neighbors."
 #fortress_building:0 "Fortress"
 #fortress_building_desc:1 "The construction of stand-alone fortresses was not that common in the classical world, but the construction of walls to protect whole cities, such as the Servian Wall in Rome, or constructing a fortified citadel on its acropolis, such as the fabled Seven-Gated Wall of the Kadmeia of Thebes, was quite widespread. The most famous fortification work of the Hellenic world was the Long Walls of Athens, which connected Athens itself with its port Peiraieus."
 commerce_building:0 "Marketplace"
 commerce_building_desc:1 "Early marketplaces were informal phenomena, often appearing in the fields outside a city, primarily focused on places where people congregated. As city-states grew, these Agorai often developed into the center for commercial, religious, political, and cultural life; the beating heart of any city. The Greek Agora even influenced the set-up and the significance of both the Roman Fora and the Carthaginian marketplaces."
 population_building:0 "Granary"
 population_building_desc:1 "The issue of storing food-stuffs from one harvest to the next is as old as agriculture itself. Various ancient cultures came up with solutions to storing grain over long periods while keeping it dry and pest-free; from the raised floors of Roman Granarium, the dug out pits of the Greek Silo, to the Egyptian use of cats to keep pests under control. Long-term storage of grain allowed for a food surplus, a prerequisite for population growth, and eventually civilization itself."
 forum_building:0 "Forum"
 forum_building_desc:1 "Influenced by the Greek Agora, the Roman Forum was the hub of the Eternal City. Apart from the commercial, judicial and religious activities of the Forum, its main function was that of political nucleus, where the senators convened in the Comitium, and where the Roman Populus came to hear political speeches, and assembled to cast their vote in elections."
 workshop_building:1 "Mill"
 workshop_building_desc:1 "The use of small-scale hand-powered mills in the home has been around since the beginning of human agriculture. Larger versions can be powered by draft-animals. The later invention of the watermill enabled their use in mining and construction as tools for crushing ore and cutting wood and marble. Watermills generally decreased reliance on human and animal powered labor, substantially increasing productivity and efficiency in the production of raw materials."
 library_building:0 "Library"
 library_building_desc:1 "The earliest known library was the Hittite collection of cuneiform tablets in Hattusa from 1900 BCE, but large institutional libraries became more common in the 3rd century BCE. They were commonly archives for empires or kingdoms, but also for religious institutions, or attached to institutions of higher learning. The largest and most famous library of the ancient world was the Great Library of Alexandria, which may have contained up to 400,000 texts at its height. The destruction of the Great Library is considered as one of the greatest tragedies of the ancient world."
 town_hall_building:1 "Tax Office"
 town_hall_building_desc:1 "Every government needs a treasury to house the funds necessary for a functioning state-apparatus, such as public building projects or troop wages. The treasury of ancient Rome, the Aerarium Populi Romani, was located in the Temple of Saturn on the Forum Romanum, which also housed legionary standards, senate decrees, and the laws of Rome engraved on brass tablets. The funds were mainly from tax income, collected by the Publicani, Roman Equites who had won contract bids for the right to farm taxes in a specified province."
 theathre_building:1 "Grand Theater"
 theathre_building_desc:1 "Early Greek theater was a relatively simple affair, with a choir and masked actors performing in front of the Skene, a building that served as a backdrop, and seats built into a hillside. The Romans adopted the Greek architecture for their theaters, but built them as free-standing structures, which in turn allowed them to build completely circular theater buildings, or amphitheaters. Due to the different acoustic effects of normal semi-circular theaters and amphitheaters, they tended to host different types of events. Theaters would host plays, pantomimes, and speeches, while amphitheaters, such as the famous Amphitheatrum Flavium, would host gladiatorial combats, races, or sometimes, as in 80 CE, reenactments of naval battles, Naumachiae."
 court_building:1 "Court of Law"
 court_building_desc:1 "The most common form of Roman litigation during the Republic, Legis Actiones, Actions of Law, involved a formal hearing in front of a magistrate, upon which a judge was agreed upon by both parties. The judge had to be a Roman citizen of senatorial rank, and was selected from a list called the Album Iudicum, but did not need to have any legal training or expertise. After this the trial was held in a public place, usually the Forum Romanum, during which either side could be represented by an advocate. At the end, the judge would rule in whatever manner seemed most just."
 academy_building:0 "Academy"
 academy_building_desc:1 "The first academy was founded by Plato in the early 4th century BCE, on a property he owned on the Akademeia, a hill outside Athens, where there was a grove of olive trees dedicated to Athena, goddess of wisdom. Plato lectured and posed problems to the Academy's members. Later, his student Aristotle would found the Lyceum, his own academy in Athens proper, where Aristotle would pass on his philosophy, and where he founded a library. Both schools were destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 86 BCE during his siege of Athens."
 temple_building:1 "Great Temple"
 temple_building_desc:1 "Temples are religious spaces, often buildings containing a shrine, dedicated to a deity. These could often have secondary functions beyond the religious, such as the Temple of Saturn in Rome doubling as the state treasury, the olive grove dedicated to Athena at the Akademeia being the site of Plato's academy, or the Campus Martius, the Field of Mars, being the site of annual Roman military muster. Even the Roman senate had to convene in a space dedicated to the gods. The most famous ancient temple is probably the temple of Athena, the Parthenon, in Athens, the ruins of which can still be seen today."
 foundry_building:0 "Foundry"
 foundry_building_desc:1 "In Ancient Rome, Fabricae or Officinae were workshops or manufactories that worked in hard materials like metal and stone. Officinae Armorum, armories, would produce arms and armor, but such smithies could also produce iron nails and fittings for use by ship-wrights and in construction. In the later Imperial period, state-run Fabricae would produce arms and armor for whole legions. Hephaistos, the Greek god of fire and smithing, operated an armory, where he forged the legendary arms and armor of the gods."
 aqueduct_building:0 "Aqueduct"
 aqueduct_building_desc:1 "Although most associated with Rome, aqueducts are believed to have appeared first on the Indian subcontinent. In Greece also, constructions such as the Epaulinian Aqueduct on Samos, which brought fresh-water to Pythagoreion, are from as early as the 6th century BCE. Aqueducts would bring fresh water to cities and to the countryside for irrigation from faraway rivers. The longest known aqueduct from antiquity is the Aqueduct of Valens, built in Constantinopolis in the 3rd to 4th century CE and brought water from over 250 kilometers away. The entire structure was over 400 kilometers in length."
 

 #settlement buildings
 latifundia_building:0 "Slave Estate"
 latifundia_building_desc:1 "In the ancient world, citizenship and military service was tied to land ownership. Only land owners had the privilege of suffrage, and a duty to perform military service. Over time, more and more land was bought by the more affluent classes, and gathered farmland into larger estates, in Latin called Latifundia. These estates were worked by slaves, and grew primarily cash crops, which were more valuable than food."
 slave_mine_building:0 "Mine"
 slave_mine_building_desc:1 "Mining has been part of human civilization for millennia. Mines allow for more effective ore removal than surface mining, as one can reach deeper ore deposits with less effort. The oldest mining complex in the world is believed to be in Nazlet Sabaha, north of Luxor, along the banks of the Nile, which is believed to have been dug 50,000 years ago."
 basic_settlement_infratructure_building:0 "Farming Settlement"
 basic_settlement_infratructure_building_desc:1 "After the appearance of agriculture, somewhere between 11,000 and 9,500 BCE, the first large-scale farming settlements appeared in the Fertile Crescent around 9,000 BCE. The common pooling of resources gave human societies the freedom to specialize, and branch out into other areas of production, like smithing, carpentry, and trading, but also prefaced the growth of arts and culture, such as poetry, theater, and learning. A strong agricultural surplus is essential to the development of human civilization."
 hill_fort:0 "Tribal Settlement"
 hill_fort_desc:1 "Tribal communities are close-knit rural groups of fiercely independent people. In the early history of Rome, a tribe, or a Tribus, originally referred to such subgroups, which became the basis for the voting classes of the Populus when the city was founded. Even though the rural lifestyle disappeared, Romans retained their tribal-mentality long after they became urban, and were slow to adopt foreign customs and traditions."
 local_forum_building:0 "Provincial Legation"
 local_forum_building_desc:0 "In Republican Rome conquered territory was divided into provinces, and administration of the provinces was left in the hands of Roman magistrates with Imperium. Generally these provinces had a high level of self-governance, and the governor only intervened in matters that directly pertained to the Roman state, such as taxation and presiding over judicial trials involving Roman citizens. One of the symbols of a magistrate's Imperium was the curule chair, which could be folded up and transported to wherever the magistrate was needed to perform his duties."
 barracks_building:0 "Barracks"
 barracks_building_desc:1 "While on the march, Roman legions would build semi-fortified camps called Castra. These were little more than palisades around their camps with a moat dug out. They would be dismantled every morning, and rebuilt in a new location in the evening. When the legion built winter quarters, the Castra would be upgraded with better fortifications and more amenities. Frequently in the more remote provinces, as a permanent military presence was established, the palisades and tents of the winter quarters would be replaced with stone buildings to house the provincial legions assigned to the governor."
