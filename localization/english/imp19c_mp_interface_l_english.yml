 card_the_concert_of_europe:0 "#T The concert of Europe#!\nIn 1815, Europe was a place of fear and uncertainty. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Great French Revolution, the old order was destroyed, and the new ones had not yet had time to form.\n\nEuropean leaders feared a new wave of revolutions and feared a repeat of the events of 1799-1814. This forced them to gather at the Congress of Vienna to restore feudal relations and absolute monarchies, return lands and titles to the former ruling dynasties, and develop mechanisms to combat revolutionary movements.\n\nThe meetings of the Vienna Congress were held irregularly, and their essence was to coordinate the decisions already taken at informal social events. As a result of the congress, compromise decisions were made that determined the development of Europe for the first half of the 19th century."
