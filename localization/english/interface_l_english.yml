 EPIINTRO:1 "#T Epirus#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nThe kingdom of Epirus occupies a unique position, protected from the Macedonian kingdom by geography, dominating the Ionian coast, and a stones throw from the rich lands of Magna Graecia. However, if the westward ambitions of Alexandros of Epirus, uncle of Alexander the Great, are to be realized, Molossian disputes over the Epirote succession must be settled, and the power of Macedon, Aetolia, and the Illyrian tribes checked in the fallout of the Diadochi wars."
 SPAINTRO:1 "#T Sparta#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThough the heady glories of Thermopylai and the Peloponnesian war are now half-remembered dreams, the Spartan kingdom looks to the collapse of Alexander's Macedonian empire as an opportunity to reignite the flame of Laconian supremacy by dominating the Peloponnese once more. This may be more difficult than it sounds; Sparta's neighbors and old enemies in Messenia and Arcadia fraternize in a cowardly alliance out of fear for sight of our hoplites on the horizon."
 SYRINTRO:1 "#T Syracuse#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe city of Syracuse now totally dominates the other towns of eastern Sicily, an island which has been ravaged by centuries of war between Punic and the Greek interests, and the rise and fall of brutal tyrant kings. The city of Arethousa must recover her former glory while defending against Carthaginian and nascent Italic threats if the island's Hellenic cities are to survive the coming decades and honor their ancestor's victory over Athen's Sicilian expedition."
 ATHINTRO:1 "#T Athens#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe glorious days of Marathon, Pericles, and the Delian League are but a distant memory to the citizens of the once mighty city of Athenai, which along with much of Greece now endures under the Macedonian yoke. Viewed as the most important city of the Hellenes by all but the Dorians, Athens must show leadership if she is to survive the ravages of the Diadochi wars and aspire to her former greatness as the liberator and protector of Greece."
 MASINTRO:1 "#T Massilia#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nMassilia is the most successful of the Greek cities of the western Mediterranean, and the main city of the Phocaean colonists, founding the trading posts of Emporion and Hemeroskopeion in Iberia to profit from the flow of trade between the Greek world and the barbarian tribes of this untamed region. The city's survival will depend on a shrewd mixture of diplomacy and opportunism, ensuring the natives are not able to overrun this Hellenic bastion in Gaul."
 TREINTRO:1 "#T Thrace#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nThe satrapy of Lysimachos is looked down upon as the smallest and most remote of the Diadochi kingdoms. Once vital as the bridge between Macedon and the east, the division of Alexander's empire leaves its barbarian lands and Greek colonies lackluster when compared to the riches of other successor kingdoms. To succeed, steps must be taken to counter Antigonid dominance to the south, while ensuring Macedon is not underestimated as a potential enemy to the west."
