 introduction_events.1.t:1 "The Mexican War of Independence"
 introduction_events.1.desc:1 "Five years ago, amidst the chaos of the Spanish war of independence, the fires of the Mexican independence wars were sparked by Miguel Hidalgo in Dolores, despite his execution, the revolt was able to organize and fight under the leadership of José María Morelos.\n\ \n\ Despite the attempts to organize a coherent government, the situation now is that the leadership of Morelos is all keeping the revolt coherent under the constant threat of the royalist army led by Agustín de Iturbide and the evil viceroy Calleja.\n\ If our great caudillo were to be killed or captured before he stabilizes the situation in the new nation, we would have to resort to guerrilla tactics under the leadership of Vicente Guerrero or Guadalupe Victoria.\n\ \n\ The time is ripe to give a final push and kick the spanish out of the Americas once and for all."
 introduction_events.1.a:0 "La Patria es Primero."
 introduction_events.2.t:0 "The Spanish Empire"
 introduction_events.2.desc:2 "The Spain of the Siglo de Oro and of the uncontested Bourboun Dynasty is no more.\n\ In 1815, Ferdinand VII has just been re-instated on the throne, and fully intends to undo the hard-fought-for Constitution of Càdiz that eliminated any distinction between the Spanish born in the Old World and the Spanish born in the colonies, gave limited rights to all citizens, and seemed to align itself to the ideals of the hated French Invaders.\n\ Reactionary forces clash with radical ones for the control of the country, and the colonies that used to be the lifeblood and the pride of the Spanish Crown have become a restless nightmare that saps many resources and threatens the standing of Spain, if not her very existence.\n\ \n\ There may be a dawn, at the end of this long night, but it definitely won't be reached easily."
 introduction_events.2.a:0 "¡Santiago, y cierra, España!"
 introduction_events.3.t:0 "The Congress Poland"
 introduction_events.3.desc:3 " The once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist a mere 20 years ago. The patriotic fervour, re-ignited by the Napoleon in recent years is still burning strong. Although the Duchy of Warsaw was just a French puppet, it gave the Polish people a hope for indenpendence.\n\ \n\  Now, under Russian rule, Poles have to decide whether they should follow their stubborn nature and try to break their chains by force, flooding the country with blood once again...  or whether they should stay docile and obedient to buy some long deserved peace...\n\ \n\  at least for now."
 introduction_events.3.a:0 "Poland is not lost... yet?"
 introduction_events.4.t:0 "The Land of the Rising Sun"
 introduction_events.4.desc:4 "It has been 182 years now since the nation of Japan closed its doors to the outside world, during this period of Sakoku(鎖国), our great nation has enjoyed a peace never before seen, all is well and the bakufu of the Tokugawa clan serves the best interests of the Crysanthenum throne.\n\ However, despite the harmony lived in our lands, the outside world has not stopped moving, and its gears are starting to make things move, however slowly. We stand at a crossroads, keep our way of life, or try to further understand the world, the artifacts brought by the dutch sailors are evermore advanced and sofisticated, perhaps the time is ripe.\n\ \n\ Will Japan be recognizable after this century? The Shogun Tokugawa Ienari and the Kokaku emperor might not see it now but things are slowly changing in our ever rigid society."

 introduction_events.5.t:0 "Hispanoamerican Independence"
 introduction_events.5.desc:4 "It is the year of our lord 1815, most of South America is in turmoil, with the occupation of Spain by the Napoleonic France in 1808 we now face the opportunity of a lifetime to free ourselves from the spanish yoke that had us chained for centuries, we shall fight to see our freedom and defeat the royalist holdouts once and for all.\n\ We shall forge a new future under the guise of freedom and our ideals and we shall not be under spanish rule again. the time is right to see our legacy built."
 introduction_events.5.a:0 "Freedom or Death!"
 introduction_events.6.t:0 "El Libertador"
 introduction_events.6.desc:0 "War to the death has been declared, all the Spaniards and Canarians who will not aid in our independence shall be put to death.\n\ \n\ The failures of the first Venezuelan Republic were great, and our state is in dire turmoil due to internal conflicts, civil strife between the llaneros, whites and mestizos, federalists and centralists, we shall either triumph together against the Crown or perish in our attempts.\n\ \n\ Rumours speak of a large host of peninsulares getting ready at Cadiz to sail and fight us, led by the veteran general Pablo Morillo we might need to regroup in Haiti if the situation grows too hostile.\n\ \n\ Nevertheless the dream of an independent and united Colombia shall never die."
 introduction_events.6.a:0 "Bolívar will lead us to victory!"
 introduction_events.7.t:0 "The Russian Empire"
 introduction_events.7.desc:0 "Russia's experience and history has been very different from that of all other European countries. \n\ \n\ Indeed, it is not strictly correct to call Russia European, for the greater part of its vast lands lies in Asia. Situated as she is across two continents, and made up of over a hundred different national groups, each with their own culture and traditions, Russia is indeed a great continental empire. These disparate areas are held together by the all-powerful figure of the Tsar. Many Russians are still suspicious of any new-fangled ideas from the West and believe in the superiority of their own traditional view of the world. However, more critical, and often better educated, Russians are beginning to see their country as backward and out of step with the modern world but despair of doing anything about it. \n\ \n\ With his mental health deteriorating, the Emperor and Autocrat Alexander I is growing increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive."

 introduction_events.8.t:0 "The Duchy of Lucca"
 introduction_events.8.desc:0 "In 1815, Lucca is coming back from French annexation. With Napoleon ending the 650-years old republic, and the enthroning of Maria Luisa di Borbone Parma as duchess, the city has found itself with a severe identity crisis as the former patrician families struggle to find a new niche to occupy within the changed social texture of the city. The loss of importance of silk trading however, has been finally solved, as the city builds its first factory, a tobacco processing plant, and industrious peoples try to figure out new ways to make paper, an export that had been neglected in comparison to silk. \n\ \n\ The city has also considered the possibility of exploiting its sea access not for naval usage, but as a stopover for the Ground Touring aristocracy of the rest of Europe, though this has been found fairly unpopular with the more agrarian centres of Camaiore and Pian di Conca."
 introduction_events.8.a:0 "Libertas!"
 introduction_events.9.t:0 "The Decline of Peter's Patrimony"
 introduction_events.9.desc:0 "Ever since the time of Charlemagne, the Holy See has controlled vast areas of Italy with secular lords of varying loyalty, and fought against anyone and everything threatening it with fervor. Once one of the most powerful and influential powers in the entire European continent, the Papal State has spiraled down into narrowmindedness and obscurantism, rejecting a great deal of the previous century's innovations, both of the ideological and of the technological kind, while greatly relying on the lip service the Catholic powers paid to it and its prestige as one of the greatest artistic centres of its time. The Napoleonic Wars, however, have awakened an urge of change in the hearts of the Pope's subjects: in Bologna people revolt and demand change, while in the rural parts of Romagna brigands make their displeasure known by robbing tax collectors and other representatives of the Pope's temporal power, and in Rome, several liberal-minded men plot to restore a truly Roman Republic, one not beholden to the caprices and fears of the Pope. In 1815, the Papal State is facing a time of turmoil and is going to face the great challange of leaving its centuries-long torpor behind before it's too late..."

 introduction_events.10.t:0 "The Duchy of Parma"
 introduction_events.10.desc:0 "Formely one of the last holdouts of the Spanish influence in the north of Italy, the duchy is being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty once more: Maria Luisa of Habsburg-Parma is the daughter of Franz I of Austria, and in her currently-short reign she has shown a reformist streak, accepting the French reforms applied to the state, while also ensuring no actual French collaborator could destabilize the state.\n\ \n\ Parma, with her fertile lands made even more productive thanks to the new methodologies introduced by the French, is very much an agrarian economy, though hardly a stagnating one. That being said, Austrian influence might prove overbearing, and there's no garauntee Maria Luisa will be able to sire a suitable heir, and as such, the nobles are preparing themselves for a return of the Bourbons, once the Duchess expires..."

 introduction_events.11.t:0 "The Duchy of Modena"
 introduction_events.11.desc:0 "The Duchy of Modena suffered the most out of all Italian states from the Napoleonic conquests: the entire artistic patrimony of the d'Este family was taken away; the clergy's land has been expropriated and sold off to the best acquirer, only to end up in Jewish hands once the Pope threatened excommunication for buying those lands; and the precarious agricultural balance has been broken. It should come at no surprise, then, that Francesco IV has decided to abolish and abhor any French innovation not strictly related to now-unchangable administrative divisions, acting as one of the most fervent supporters of Restorationist thought. \n\ \n\ It will take time for Modena to fully recover, and, even then, there's no guarantee it will recover fast enough to be able to keep rejecting the wider world's ideas."

 introduction_events.12.t:0 "The Duchy of Massa"
 introduction_events.12.desc:0 "Massa-Carrara has always been the smallest of all Italian states, famous only for their pristinely white marble used by many Reinessance artists and beyond; and the Cybo-Malaspina family, which married into several major European houses, but never managed to get a proper hold on anything larger. The territory has been mostly left alone ever since indipendence from Florence in 1488, surviving all major European wars mostly undisturbed, until Napoleon briefly suppressed them. \n\ \n\ Massa is not expected to last much longer, as Maria Beatrice d'Este's heir apparent, Francesco IV d'Este, is already ruling the Duchy of Parma. However, his brothers Massimiliano Giuseppe and Ferdinando Carlo Giuseppe could have other plans in store for the tiny duchy..."

 introduction_events.13.t:0 "The Grandduchy of Tuscany"
 introduction_events.13.desc:0 "The Grandduchy of Tuscany, coming back from both a brief period as a puppet state called "Etruria" and as part of the French State, has been restored and, thanks to some diplomatic manuvering, it even has managed to expand its borders, annexing the State of Presidi and the Spanish aberration of the Principality of Piombino.  \n\  In spite of the end of French occupation, Ferdinand III has decided to not only bring back the ban on death penalty his father implemented in 1786, but also to integrate the French administration and laws, thus making Tuscany one of the most forward-thinking states in Europe. \n\ \n\ But not all is well in the land of Dante and Macchiavelli: war has severely delayed the reclamation effort of Maremma, thus keeping Grosseto and nearby centres as hotspots of malaria with limited appeal, in spite of the very fertile land outside the swamps; and Pistoia has become a hotbed for secret society activity.  \n\ \n\ While in a better position than most in the Italian Peninsula, Tuscany cannot afford to stop and will have to quickly re-establish its economy, whether by focusing on the navy in Livorno and Piombino or on the finery of life in the entreterre, if it wishes to strike out on her own once again."
 introduction_events.13.a:0 "We will rise again."
 introduction_events.14.t:0 "The Kingdom of Sardinia"
 introduction_events.14.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sardinia, the end result of centuries of petty conquests and political manuvering from the ancient House di Savoia, has slowly broke away from its past Alpine French identity and embraced a culture closer to the one found in the Italian peninsula as the result of Genoa's annexation. In 1815, Carlo Felice di Savoia has wholeheartedly embraced Restorationist thought, but his heir apparent, despite his manifest neurosis, has more liberal ideals, which has caused the hopes of many within the kingdom's high society for real change to soar, like a proper constitution, thought it is unknown if it will succeed at all. \n\ \n\ Meanwhile, industrialization has produced its first weak birth cries, as a royal foundry is founded to supply the army with weapons, and as Genoa's shipwright industry coalesces to form a more coherent whole."

 introduction_events.15.t:0 "The Kingdom of Naples"
 introduction_events.15.desc:0 "The Napoleonic Wars have been a tumultous period for Naples, even for the standards of the continent at the time. First conquered by the French, the territory was assigned to Joacquin Murat, who governed it by imposing as many liberal reforms as possible before being violently opposed by sanfedists - poor farmers led by noblemen and clergymen loyal to the previous king and utterly opposed to the principles of the French Revolution. \n\ \n\ The struggle has never truly ended, as Murat is still trying to reclaim the throne in 1815. This has left Naples, already a state with a tendency to concentrate wealth in a handful of cities at the expense of everything else, in an even more precarious position. \n\ \n\ Latifundial nobles are using the chaos to cover massive areas of the kingdom with their possessions, tended by thousands of nominally free but contractually bound farmers growing wheat the way they always have. Ferdinand IV has finally returned from his exhile in Sicily, however, and he doesn't intend leaving the kingdom to rot and fester. He has decreed some of Murat's reforms to be valid, and has decided to curb the power of the latifundists, while also still supporting nascient industries. Time will tell if it will be enough to end the slump the Kingdom of Naples has suffered ever since the Spanish left..."

 introduction_events.16.t:0 "The Kingdom of Sicily"
 introduction_events.16.desc:0 "Sicily has seen better days. The population is mostly composed of subsistence farmers under the thumb of absentee (but still oppressive) landlords, sulphur miners living in brutal condictions, and urban poor who eke out an existence. Very little wealth circulates on the island. The few wealthy people on the island are loath to lose their privileges, and in 1812, supported by the British diplomatic delegation, forced Francis III's hand into signing a Constitution that gave the barons even more powers than the ones afforded to them until that time, and eliminated the Catholic Church's competition altogether by confiscating all of the Church's goods. \n\ \n\ However, in 1815, Francis III has made clear that he fully intends to return to Naples and be more Ferdinand IV of Naples than Ferdinand III of Sicily. He has signalled his wish to roll back the Constitution in order to restore order in the realm. In all of this, the clergy is trying to use the downtrodden to rise up against the nobles' treachery. Meanwhile, the nobles are trying to capitalize on their free rein, hoping that they will be able to make an offer that Francis cannot refuse before he decides to restore rule from Naples..."

 introduction_events.17.t:0 "The Kingdom of Venetia-Lombardy"
 introduction_events.17.desc:0 "After centuries of struggle, Milan and Venice are under one state at last. Trouble is, neither city is in power; Vienna is. \n\ \n\ After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 that ended the plurisecular Republic of Venice, and after the Congress of Vienna dissolved the puppet Kingdom of Italy, the two bitter rivals were forced into a single adminsitrative division, due to Austrian fears of invigorating separatism otherwise, and because it made it easier for the Empire to access to a third of their tax base. \n\ \n\ Francis I, son of the former Grandduke of Tuscany, is king in name only, and the Viceroy Heinrich Von Reuss zu Plauen is but a puppet of the governors Heinrich Johann Bellegarde in Lombardy and Peter Goëss in Veneto. As the governors try to implement the best policies to keep the populations quiet and the cashflow steady, the disgruntled urban populations wonder if there can be another way, and if the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy was not an entirely insane idea after all. In any case, this odd union has a tumultous future before itself, and only a very lucky and organized hand can make it weather it successfully."

 introduction_events.18.t:0 "The young American Republic"
 introduction_events.18.desc:0 "Coming off its second war with Britain in its short existence, the United States finds itself reaffirming its sovereignty in what it considers its "Second War of Independence." The War of 1812 has a larger internal effect on the nation, however. After a successful end to the war and a rousing victory at the Battle of New Orleans, the political struggles that the nation found itself facing over the last 30 years subsided in unexpected ways. \n\ \n\ The Hartford Convention brought about a Federalist attempt to embarrass the Democrat-Republicans and use this as a bargaining chip to bring about change, but after news of the victories in the war reached Washington the Federalists found themselves disgraced. Associated with treason and secession, the Federalists are quickly falling out of public favor once and for all. \n\ \n\ The United States in 1815 finds itself at the dawn of a new era. With ample land to its west for expansion, a newly unified political system, and a national spirit that has found itself energized once more, the future looks bright for this American republic as it dives headfirst into its Era of Good Feelings."

 introduction_events.19.desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire, once united and dominant among the great world powers, has started to fracture at its seams. In 1808, #Y Sultan Selim III#! was deposed by a Janissary revolt by discontented elements who resisted attempts to modernize the empire. This resulted in the temporary reign of #Y Mustafa IV#!, who would be deposed by a counter-revolt by the current Sultan #Y Mahmud II#! and his supporters. \n\n The result of the turmoil that arose from 1808 is the #G Sened-i ittifak#!, a constitutional document which entrenched growing feudal elements in the country, allowing warlords and overly ambitious men to undermine the central authority of the Sublime Porte. Among these upstarts, #Y Ali Pasha#! of #Y Janina #! perhaps poses the greatest immediate threat, seemingly expressing little respect for the Sultan and outright defying our authority. This constitutional situation is something the Grand Vizier #Y Alemdar Mustafa Pasha#! strongly advocates the state ignore, instead arguing for the disbandment of feudal elements and centralization of the realm. \n\n In the peripheries of the Empire, our vassal's son #Y Ibrahim Pasha#! leads a military campaign against the Emirate of #Y Diriyah#!. The upstart Emirate has raided our caravans and thrusted deep into our territory, temporarily seizing control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina! The Emirate disputes our right as Caliph and wishes to spread its religious sect across the Islamic world."

 introduction_events.20.desc:0 "The #Y Great Qing Empire#!, in this 19th year of the Jiaqing Era, is rightfully called the centre of the world. Chinese silk, tea and porcelain can be found in households around the globe, and the Empire's scholarly culture remains the standard its neighbours strive to follow. \n\ \n\ In the 179 years since Emperor Taizong established the Qing, the Aisin-Gioro clan has never let down its guard and never forgotten that this empire was won on the backs of horses. Beijing serves as the capital of a transnational empire encompassing the bustling cities and fertile farmlands of China and the hardy warrior tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria. In the north, south and west our generals and viceroys keep the peace.
