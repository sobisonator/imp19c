 introduction_events.1.t:1 "The Mexican War of Independence"
 introduction_events.1.desc:1 "Five years ago, amidst the chaos of the Spanish war of independence, the fires of the Mexican independence wars were sparked by Miguel Hidalgo in Dolores, despite his execution, the revolt was able to organize and fight under the leadership of José María Morelos.\n\ \n\ Despite the attempts to organize a coherent government, the situation now is that the leadership of Morelos is all keeping the revolt coherent under the constant threat of the royalist army led by Agustín de Iturbide and the evil viceroy Calleja.\n\ If our great caudillo were to be killed or captured before he stabilizes the situation in the new nation, we would have to resort to guerrilla tactics under the leadership of Vicente Guerrero or Guadalupe Victoria.\n\ \n\ The time is ripe to give a final push and kick the spanish out of the Americas once and for all."

 introduction_events.2.t:0 "The Spanish Empire"
 introduction_events.2.desc:2 "The Spain of the Siglo de Oro and of the uncontested Bourboun Dynasty is no more.\n\ In 1815, Ferdinand VII has just been re-instated on the throne, and fully intends to undo the hard-fought-for Constitution of Càdiz that eliminated any distinction between the Spanish born in the Old World and the Spanish born in the colonies, gave limited rights to all citizens, and seemed to align itself to the ideals of the hated French Invaders.\n\ Reactionary forces clash with radical ones for the control of the country, and the colonies that used to be the lifeblood and the pride of the Spanish Crown have become a restless nightmare that saps many resources and threatens the standing of Spain, if not her very existence.\n\ \n\ There may be a dawn, at the end of this long night, but it definitely won't be reached easily."

 introduction_events.3.t:0 "The Congress Poland"
 introduction_events.3.desc:3 " The once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist a mere 20 years ago. The patriotic fervour, re-ignited by the Napoleon in recent years is still burning strong. Although the Duchy of Warsaw was just a French puppet, it gave the Polish people a hope for indenpendence.\n\ \n\  Now, under Russian rule, Poles have to decide whether they should follow their stubborn nature and try to break their chains by force, flooding the country with blood once again...  or whether they should stay docile and obedient to buy some long deserved peace...\n\ \n\  at least for now."

 introduction_events.4.desc:4 "It has been 182 years now since the nation of Japan closed its doors to the outside world, during this period of Sakoku(鎖国), our great nation has enjoyed a peace never before seen, all is well and the bakufu of the Tokugawa clan serves the best interests of the Crysanthenum throne.\n\ However, despite the harmony lived in our lands, the outside world has not stopped moving, and its gears are starting to make things move, however slowly. We stand at a crossroads, keep our way of life, or try to further understand the world, the artifacts brought by the dutch sailors are evermore advanced and sofisticated, perhaps the time is ripe.\n\ \n\ Will Japan be recognizable after this century? The Shogun Tokugawa Ienari and the Kokaku emperor might not see it now but things are slowly changing in our ever rigid society."

 introduction_events.7.t:0 "The Russian Empire"
 introduction_events.7.desc:0 "Russia's experience and history has been very different from that of all other European countries.\n\  Indeed, it is not strictly correct to call Russia European, the greater part of its vast lands lies in Asia. Situated as she is across two continents, and made up of over a hundred different national groups, each with their own culture and traditions, Russia is indeed a great continental empire. These disparate areas are held together by the all-powerful figure of the Tsar. Many Russians are still suspicious of any new-fangled ideas from the West and believe in the superiority of their own traditional view of the world. However, more critical, and often better educated, Russians are beginning to see their country as backward and out of step with the modern world but despair of doing anything about it.\n\  With his mental health deteriorating, the Tsar Alexander I is growing increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive."

 introduction_events.8.desc:0 "In 1815, Lucca is coming back from French annexation. With Napoleon ending the 650-years old republic, and the enthroning of Maria Luisa di Borbone Parma, the city has found itself with a severe identity crisis, as the former patrician families struggle to find a new niche to occupy within the changed social texture of the city. The loss of importance of silk trading however, has been finally solved, as the city builds its first factory, a tobacco processing plant, and industrious peoples try to figure out new ways to make paper, an export that had been neglected in comparison to silk. /n/ The city has also considered the possibility of exploiting its sea access not for naval usage, but as a stopover for the Ground Touring aristocracy of the rest of Europe, though this has been found fairly unpopular with the more agrarian centres of Camaiore and Pian di Conca."

 introduction_events.9.t:0 "The Decline of Peter's Patrimony"
 introduction_events.9.desc:0 "Ever since the time of Charlemagne, the Holy See has controlled vast areas of Italy with secular lords of varying loyalty, and fought against anyone and everything threatening it with fervor. Once one of the most powerful and influential powers in the entire European continent, the Papal State has spiraled down into narrowmindedness and obscurantism, rejecting a great deal of the previous century's innovations, both of the ideological and of the technological kind, while greatly relying on the lip service the Catholic powers paid to it and its prestige as one of the greatest artistic centres of its time. The Napoleonic Wars, however, have awakened an urge of change in the hearts of the Pope's subjects: in Bologna people revolt and demand change, while in the rural parts of Romagna brigands make their displeasure known by robbing tax collectors and other representatives of the Pope's temporal power, and in Rome, several liberal-minded men plot to restore a truly Roman Republic, one not beholden to the caprices and fears of the Pope. In 1815, the Papal State is facing a time of turmoil and is going to face the great challange of leaving its centuries-long torpor behind before it's too late..."

 introduction_events.10.t:0 "The Duchy of Parma"
 introduction_events.10.desc:0 "Formely one of the last holdouts of the Spanish influence in the north of Italy, the duchy is being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty once more: Maria Luisa of Habsburg-Parma is the daughter of Franz I of Austria, and in her currently-short reign she has shown a reformist streak, accepting the French reforms applied to the state, while also ensuring no actual French collaborator could destabilize the state.\n\ \n\ Parma, with her fertile lands made even more productive thanks to the new methodologies introduced by the French, is very much an agrarian economy, though hardly a stagnating one. That being said, Austrian influence might prove overbearing, and there's no garauntee Maria Luisa will be able to sire a suitable heir, and as such, the nobles are preparing themselves for a return of the Bourbons, once the Duchess expires..."

 introduction_events.11.t:0 "The Duchy of Modena"
 introduction_events.11.desc:0 "The Duchy of Modena suffered the most out of all Italian states from the Napoleonic conquests: the d'Este's entire artistic patrimony was taken away; the clergy's land has been expropriated and sold off to the best acquirer, only to end up in Jewish hands once the Pope threatened excommunication for buying those lands; and the precarious agricultural balance has been broken: it should come at no surprise, then, that Francesco IV has decided to abolish and abhor any French innovation not strictly related to now-unchangable administrative divisions, acting as one of the most fervent supporters of Restaurationist thought.\n\ \n\ It will take time for Modena to fully recover, and, even then, there's no garauntee it will be fast enough to be able to keep rejecting the wider world's theories and ideas for long."

 introduction_events.12.desc:0 "Massa-Carrara has always been the smallest of all Italian states, famous only for their pristinely white marble used by many Reinessance artists and beyond; and the Cybo-Malaspina family, which married into several major European houses, but never managed to get a proper hold on anything larger. The territory has been mostly left alone ever since indipendence from Florence in 1488, surviving all major European wars mostly undisturbed, until Napoleon briefly suppressed them. \n\ \n\ Massa is not expected to last much longer, as Maria Beatrice d'Este's heir apparent, Francesco IV d'Este, is already ruling the Duchy of Parma. However, his brothers Massimiliano Giuseppe and Ferdinando Carlo Giuseppe could have other plans in store for the tiny duchy..."

 introduction_events.13.desc:0 "The Grandduchy of Tuscany, coming back from both a brief period as a puppet state called "Etruria" and as part of the French State, has been restored and, thanks to some diplomatic manuvering, it even has managed to expand its borders, annexing the State of Presidi and the Spanish aberration of the Principality of Piombino.  \n\  In spite of the end of French occupation, Ferdinand III has decided to not only bring back the ban on death penalty his father implemented in 1786, but also to integrate the French administration and laws, thus making Tuscany one of the most forward-thinking states in Europe.  \n\  \n\ But not all is well in the land of Dante and Macchiavelli: war has severely delayed the reclamation effort of Maremma, thus keeping Grosseto and nearby centres as hotspots of malaria with limited appeal, in spite of the very fertile land outside the swamps; and Pistoia has become a hotbed for secret society activity.  \n\  \n\ While in a better position than most in the Italian Peninsula, Tuscany cannot afford to stop and will have to quickly re-establish its economy, whether by focusing on the navy in Livorno and Piombino or on the finery of life in the entreterre, if it wishes to strike out on her own once again."

 introduction_events.14.t:0 "The Kingdom of Sardinia"
 introduction_events.14.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sardinia, the end result of centuries of petty conquests and political manuvering from the ancient Di Savoia dynasty, has slowly broke away from its past Alpine French identity and embraced a culture closer to the one found in the Italian peninsula as the result of Genoa's annexation. In 1815, Carlo Felice di Savoia has wholeheartedly embraced Restauration thought, but his heir apparent, despite his manifest neurosis, has more liberal ideals, which has caused the hopes of many within the kingdom's high society for real change to soar, like a proper constitution, thought it is unknown if it will succeed at all. \n\ \n\ Meanwhile, industrialization has produced its first weak birth cries, as a royal foundry is founded to supply the army with weapons, and as Genoa's shipwright industry coalesces to form a more coherent whole."

 introduction_events.15.t:0 "The Kingdom of Naples"
 introduction_events.15.desc:0 "The Napoleonic Wars have been a tumultous period for Naples, even for the standards of the continent at the time: first conquered by the French, the territory was assigned to Joacquin Murat, who governed it by imposing as many liberal reforms as possible, before being violently opposed by sanfedists, namely poor farmers lead by noblemen and clergymen loyal to the previous king and utterly opposed to the principles of the French Revolution. The struggle has never truly ended, as Murat is still trying to reclaim the throne in in 1815, and this has left Naples, already a state with a massive tendency to concentrate wealth a handful of cities at the expense of everything else, in an even more precarious position, with latifundial nobles using the chaos to cover massive areas of the kingdom in their possessions, possessions that are tended by thousands of nominally free but contractually bound farmers growing wheat the way they had always done in the past. Ferdinand IV has finally returned from his exhile in Sicily, however, and he doesn't intend leaving the kingdom to rot and fester: he has decreed some of Murat's reforms to be valid, and has decided to curb the power of the latifundists, while also still supporting nascient industries. Time will tell if it will be enough to end the slump the Kingdom of Naples has suffered ever since the Spanish left..."

 introduction_events.16.desc:0 "Sicily has seen better days: the population is mostly composed by subsistence farmers under the thumb of absentee (but still oppressive) landlords, sulphur miners living in brutal condictions, and urban poor who eke out an existence; and very little wealth circulates on the island. The few wealthy people on the island are loath to lose their privileges, and in 1812, supported by the British diplomatic delegation, forced Francis III's hand into signing a Constitution that gave the barons even more powers than the ones afforded to them until that time, and eliminated the Catholic Church's competition altogether by confiscating all of the Church's goods. However, in 1815, Francis III has made clear that he fully intends to go back to Naples and go back to be more Francis IV of Naples than Francis III of Sicily, and thus attempt to roll back the Constitution in order to restore order in the realm. In all of this, the clergy is trying to use the downtrodden to rise up agaisnt the nobles' treachery, while the nobles are trying to capitalize on their free reign, hoping that they will be able to make an offer that Francis cannot refuse before he decides to restore the status quo..."

 introduction_events.17.desc:0 "After centuries of struggle, Milan and Venice are under one state at last. Trouble is, neither city is in power: Vienna is. /n/ /n/ After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 that ended the plurisecular Republic of Venice, and after the Congress of Vienna dissolved the puppet Kingdom of Italy, the two bitter rivals were forced into a single adminsitrative division, due to Austrian fears of invigorating separatism otherwise, and because it made it easier for the Empire to access to a third of their tax base. /n/ Francis I, son of the former Grandduke of Tuscany, is king in name only, and the Viceroy Heinrich Von Reuss zu Plauen is but a puppet of the governors Heinrich Johann Bellegarde in Lombardy and Peter Goëss in Veneto. As the governors try to implement the best policies to keep the populations quiet and the cashflow steady, the disgruntled urban populations wonder if there can be another way, and if the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy was not an entirely insane idea after all. In any case, this odd union has a tumutous future before itself, and only a very lucky and organized hand can make it weather it successfully."
