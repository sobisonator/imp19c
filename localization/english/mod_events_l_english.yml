 unique_chi.1.desc:0 "Officials in [GetProvince('(int32)9298').GetName] report that the far-off Kingdom of England has requested permission to send a tribute mission to [Root.GetCapital.GetName], bearing gifts and news of the happy restoration of peace among the nations of the West. However, they probably intend to negotiate special treatment in trade with the [Root.GetName]. Their ambition is laughable, but opinions at court are divided on how we should deal with them. One faction says we should welcome them with all customary hospitality and find out what they can offer us, while others advocate denying them access to [Root.GetCapital.GetName] altogether. Some of our intelligence reports suggest that members of the English delegation are not to be trusted, in particular the young merchant known as Staunton who visited with the previous English delegation more than 20 years ago."

 unique_chi.1.b:0 "Given the unruly behaviour of these barbarians in the past, we might be wise to reject their tribute altogether."
