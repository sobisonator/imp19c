 unique_chi.1.desc:0 "Officials in [GetProvince('(int32)9298').GetName] report that the far-off kingdom of [GetCountry('GBR').GetName] has requested permission to send a tribute mission to [Root.GetCapital.GetName], bearing gifts and news of the happy restoration of peace among the nations of the West. However, they probably intend to negotiate special treatment in trade between their barbarian kingdom and the [Root.GetName]. Their ambition is laughable, but opinions at court are divided on how we should deal with them. \n \n One faction says we should welcome them with all customary hospitality and find out what they can offer us, while others advocate denying them access to [Root.GetCapital.GetName] altogether. Some of our intelligence reports suggest that members of the planned delegation are not to be trusted - in particular, the young merchant called Staunton who visited with the previous embassy more than 20 years ago."
