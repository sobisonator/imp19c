 desc_theodosian_wall_modifier:0 "The historic walls of Constantinople invoke intense melancholy among those who witness it. The walls have weathered siege and nature throughout its long history, dating back to Constantine himself, yet have undeniably decayed past its practical usefulness. Fig trees and plants cradle the battered stone, and numerous towers and sections have fallen into extreme disrepair. Sections of this wall now strangle the city, preventing its expansion beyond its historical limits."

 desc_trakehner_modifier:0 "The Trakehner is a breed of horse named after the town in which is originates from, Trakehnen, which was created as the super horse for the growingly ambitious Prussian state in the 1730s. Large swathes of forests were cleared around the river Pissa and converted into a state-owned enterprise. The horses would go to support both military and civilian purposes, being a popular breed among farmers." 
 cerro_rico_modifier:0 "Cerro Rico"
 desc_cerro_rico_modifier:0 "Cerro Rico is a mountain with terrific deposits of silver. The silver from this mine once formed the foundation of the international success of the Spanish Empire, giving it advantages in trade and finance. The fortunes generated from this mine would decrease over time, not due to an absence of silver but due to the changing attitude towards Potosi silver, which swamped international markets. The mine continues to churn out silver, despite costing the lives of hundreds of thousands of miners."

 desc_rock_of_gibraltar_modifier:0 "The Rock Of Gibraltar is a naturally strategic location, not only due its ability to help influence control over the mouth of the Mediterranean but for its defensive geological features."
