 desc_theodosian_wall_modifier:0 "The historic walls of Constantinople invoke intense melancholy among those who witness it. The walls have weathered siege and nature throughout its long history, dating back to Constantine himself, yet have undeniably decayed past its practical usefulness. Fig trees and plants cradle the battered stone, and numerous towers and sections have fallen into extreme disrepair. Sections of this wall now strangle the city, preventing its expansion beyond its historical limits."
