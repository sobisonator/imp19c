It was used to escort merchant ships and perform reconnaissance missions."
 MEDIUM_STEAMER_DESC:0 "Rowing steamships of the 19th century were small vessels that were used to transport goods and passengers along rivers and lakes.

Steam engines were powered by coal or firewood and provided sufficient power to propel the ship. \n\nRowing steamships were popular in the 19th century due to their efficiency and the ability to travel long distances. They were used to transport goods, mail, passengers and troops. \n\nThe armament of the paddle steamers was minimal and consisted of light guns to protect against pirates and other vessels."
 SCREW_FRIGATE_DESC:0 "Screw frigates are a type of warships that appeared in the middle of the 19th century. They differed from previous sailing frigates by having a steam engine and a propeller instead of oars. This allowed them to develop great speed and maneuverability, as well as use a steam engine for combat. \n\nThe first screw frigates were built in Russia and Great Britain. They had a displacement of 3 to 5 thousand tons, a length of 50 to 70 meters and a speed of up to 14 knots. The armament consisted of several dozen guns of different calibers. \n\nScrew frigates were used as cruisers, scouts and patrol ships. They participated in various naval battles and expeditions, as well as performed tasks to protect the coast and escort merchant ships."
