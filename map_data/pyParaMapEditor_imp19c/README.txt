PROVINCE SETUP EDITOR FOR IMPERATOR: ROME

Instructions:

1. Preparing data
	a) All files below simply need to be present in the setup editor's
	b) You will need 3 map files: 
		your province map, (main_input.BMP)
		a map of your land provinces with sea provinces coloured white, (land_input.BMP)
		and a map of your sea provinces with land provinces coloured white. (sea_input.BMP)
	 All of these images must be of the same dimensions.
	c) You may optionally load in an existing definition.csv and existing province_setup.csv, which will be loaded by the setup editor. If these are not present
2. Using the editor
	 - When you launch the editor you will be prompted to create a new savefile, which you can name whatever you want. This will store your edited setup data.
	 	- You may also load a previous save this way.
	 	- The map editor only takes database files in the expected format, so it will encounter an error and close if you try to open any other kind of file.
	 - Use the middle mouse button and drag the mouse to navigate the map. Alternatively, use the scrollbars around the province map canvas.
	 - Left-click on a province to select it. A crosshair will appear over the selected province while you are editing it.
	 - Click on any field on the right-hand side to edit that field.
	 	A changed field which has not yet been submitted will be coloured yellow.
	 	Press <Return> to submit your change. This will be saved to your file.
