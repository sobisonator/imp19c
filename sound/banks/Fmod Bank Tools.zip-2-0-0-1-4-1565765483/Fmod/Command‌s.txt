                     m = Multiple FSBs
-ignore_errors       Ignore errors in compilation such as "file not found"
-cache_dir           Use specified directory for cache files
-verbosity           0...5 Verbosity of logging
-allow_fsb           Allow FSBs to be used as source files
-help                Display command line help
-recursive           Recursively scan subdirectories for files
-format              <format> Target format (default = pcm)
                     Available formats :
                     pcm|pcmbigendian|adpcm|mp2|mp3|xma|at9ps4|at9psvita|vorbis|fadpcm
-quality             0...100 Compression quality (XMA/MP2/MP3/AT9/Vorbis) (default = 75)
-encryption_key      [encryptionkey] Encryption key
-no_hf_filter        XMA disable high frequency filtering (Xbox360 only)
-no_seek             XMA disable seeking to save memory (Xbox360 only)
-basic_headers       Use smaller subsound headers
-no_loop             Disable the automatic behaviour, which is to encode the file as if it was looping.
-no_interleaving     For stereo and above VAG/GCADPCM, don't interleave the data as LRLR.. instead use LLRR type encoding.
-generate_c_header   Generate a C header code file containing subsound names and indices.
-profile             Override settings with a specific profile
-thread_count        Number of threads to use for concurrent subsound encoding
-optimize_samplerate Optimize sample rate (default = off)
-write_peak_volume   Write peak volume (default = off)
-write_proj          Write out a project file instead of building a soundbank file
-rebuild             Don't load cache files, re-encode everything from scratch
-no_guid             Disable GUID generation in FSB header.
